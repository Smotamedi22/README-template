<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Since the COVID-19 pandemic began in November of 2019, schools all over the world had to adapt to a new environment, one defined by mask, at-home quarantine, and social distancing policies. With limits on social interaction, schools were forced to shift to online learning, using e-learning technology to continue operating during the pandemic. This involuntary switch was met with acceptance and rejection by Generation Z students, who were largely in high school and college during the pandemic. In this study, a theoretical framework based on the Technology Acceptance Model, TAM, was created to explore which factors are important to Generation Z students when they use e-learning technology. The factors included in the model are: Actual Use, Behavioral Intention to Use, Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Severity of COVID-19 and Voluntariness, Information Quality, Privacy and Security, Accessibility and Service/System Quality, and Compatibility and Perceived Interaction. An online survey with 66 questions was created and distributed to Generation Z university students. Beside the questions regarding the model, the survey asked for background information including e-learning experience, voluntariness in taking online course, internet quality, compatibility of their learning style to online environment and etc. In this pattern recognition project, two goals will be achieved. In first goal, the students’ background impact on the technology acceptance of the e-learning will be explored. To achieve this goal, I conducted casual inference  using EconML package. In the second goal, the framework and the relationship between factors is studied using Bayesian Network

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing
 **greatly appreciated**.
A.	Theoretical Contirbution
1. Adding a factor which capture the impact of voluntariness of use due to the COVID-19 pandemic forcing schools to shift to online distance learning. 
2. Adding a factor which capture the importance of privacy and security to Generation Z students when using online learning systems. 
3. Adding a factor which capture the effect that the risk of the COVID-19 virus has on Generation Z students’ acceptance of online learning technology. 
4. Adding a factor which capture the impact of students’ personality and learning style when using e-learning systems. 
B.	Contirbution Contirbution
1. Exploring  the impact of students’ background such as including e-learing experience, compatibility of their learning style to online environment, internet quality and etc.on the technology acceptance.
2. Exploring the framework and the relationship between factors is studied using Bayesian Network.
